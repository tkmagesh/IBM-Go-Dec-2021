Why Golang?
    1. Simplicity (python)
    2. Speed
    3. Concurrency
    4. No need for any runtime
    5. Open source


Barry Shwartz
    The Paradox of Choice 

Simple
    25 keywords
    No classes
    No inheritance
    No access modifiers
    No exceptions

Compiled
On par with "C"
Concurrency
    1000s of concurrent operations (goroutines) using one OS thread
    Parallelism is built in
    Built in scheduler
    Built for concurrency
    Language features for concurrency
        go, chan, operators ( <- ), select & range
        sync package

go run hello-world.go
go build hello-world.go
go build -o hello-world hello-world.go

Data Types in Golang
    bool
    string

    int
    int8

    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real (float32) + imaginary (float32))
    complex128 (real (float64) + imaginary (float64))

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (represent a Unicode code point (unicode character))

Assignment-1
Write a program that will print all the prime numbers between 3 to 100

Assignment-2
Display the following menu 
		1. Add
		2. Subtract
		3. Multiply
		4. Divide
		5. Exit
    If the user choice is 1 - 4, 
		accept 2 numbers 
		perform the operation
		print the result
		display the menu again
	if the user choice is 5
		exit from the application
	If the user enters any other choice 
		display "Invalid choice" 
		display the menu again.

Functions
    1. variadic functions
    2. Higher order functions
        a. anonymous functions
        b. assign functions to variables
        c. pass functions as arguments
        d. return functions from functions

    Creating a module
        go mod init <module_name>
        go mod tidy
        go mod vendor

Concurrency
    To detect race conditions
         go run --race demo-05.go

    
    Channels
        ch <- 10 => write data in to the channel
        x := <- ch => reading data from the channel
        The read operation is a 'blocking' operation

        Unbuffered channels
            A write can be successful ONLY when a read is already initiated
            If no read operation is initiated, the write operation will be blocked

P102,Pencil,20,200,Stationary
    Data => 56
    XML => 248 (5 times)
    JSON => 159 (3 times)

Define the service
Define the payload(request data, response data)
Generate proxy and the stub
Write the client code to communicate to the proxy
Write the server code to provide the service functionaly

Tools for GRPC
    Mac
        brew install protobuf
        brew install protoc-gen-go
        brew install protoc-gen-go-grpc

    Windows
        go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.26
        go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.1
        download the protoc tool from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.19.1


To generate the proxy and the stub, run the following command in the application folder
    protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto

    service.pb.go
        contains serialization information for the payload
    service_grpc.pb.go
        constain the proxy and the stub related info

Testing
    To run the tests
        go test ./... -v
