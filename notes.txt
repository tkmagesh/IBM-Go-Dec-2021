Weapons of Math Destruction
Pushkin Vertigo (publisher)
The Shadow of the Wind 

Why Golang?
    1. Simplicity (python)
    2. Speed
    3. Concurrency
    4. No need for any runtime
    5. Open source

    The Paradox of Choice 

Simple
    25 keywords
    No classes
    No inheritance
    No access modifiers
    No exceptions

Compiled
On par with "C"
Concurrency
    1000s of concurrent operations (goroutines) using one OS thread
    Parallelism is built in
    Built in scheduler
    Built for concurrency
    Language features for concurrency
        go, chan, operators ( <- ), select & range

go run hello-world.go
go build hello-world.go
go build -o hello-world hello-world.go

Data Types in Golang
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real (float32) + imaginary (float32))
    complex128 (real (float64) + imaginary (float64))

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (represent a Unicode code point (unicode character))

Assignment-1
Write a program that will print all the prime numbers between 3 to 100

Assignment-2
Display the following menu 
		1. Add
		2. Subtract
		3. Multiply
		4. Divide
		5. Exit
    If the user choice is 1 - 4, 
		accept 2 numbers 
		perform the operation
		print the result
		display the menu again
	if the user choice is 5
		exit from the application
	If the user enters any other choice 
		display "Invalid choice" 
		display the menu again.

Functions
    1. variadic functions
    2. Higher order functions
        a. anonymous functions
        b. assign functions to variables
        c. pass functions as arguments
        d. return functions from functions
